# Crypto Classification and Taxonomy

Global Crypto Classification Standard (GCCS) was originally developed by [21Shares and CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/global-crypto-classification-standard). This standard is a taxonomy for categorizing cryptoassets. GCCS allows individuals to quickly identify the functions and features of various projects and tokens within the crypto ecosystem.

In our effort to enhance this classification, we have expanded the original GCCS to include additional cryptocurrencies. We also created a more generalized classification that offers an overall view of the industry. This extended classification aims to help users perform machine classification tasks with a meaningful categorisation of assets. It can be used in ANOVA and other kinds of statistic analyses of quantitative features. Check out sheets in `crypto_taxonomy_extended.ods`.

The other table file contains crypto symbols (tickers) with names to be used in various price tracking systems.
